- **Filtering Criteria:**
  - Must have valid phone number (not "Not available" or "Contact via website")
  - Must have valid email address (contains "@" and not "Not available")
  - Both phone AND email are required

#### 2. **Updated Webhook Tester (`webhook_tester.py`)**
- Added clear documentation about filtering logic
- Updated test payload to reflect qualified lead
- Enhanced console output to show filtering status

#### 3. **Enhanced Setup Guide (`COMPLETE_WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.txt`)**

- Documented that ALL leads are still saved to CSV
- Clarified CRM push requirements

#### 4. **Created Test Script (`test_filtering_logic.py`)**
