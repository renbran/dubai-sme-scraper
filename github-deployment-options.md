# GitHub Deployment Alternatives for Dubai SME Scraper

## ❌ Why GitHub Pages Won't Work

GitHub Pages is designed for **static websites** (HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript), not server-side applications like your scraper.

**GitHub Pages can only serve:**
- Static HTML files
- CSS stylesheets  
- Client-side JavaScript
- Images and assets

**Your scraper needs:**
- Node.js runtime ❌
- Browser automation (Playwright) ❌
- System dependencies ❌
- File system access ❌
- Long-running processes ❌

## ✅ Best GitHub-Based Alternatives
