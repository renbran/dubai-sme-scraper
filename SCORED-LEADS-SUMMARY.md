## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE (For A+ Leads)

```
Subject: Property Management Automation for [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Company Name] while researching leading property 
management companies in Dubai. Your [4.8 rating / multiple properties / 
Airbnb management] caught my attention.

Many property managers we work with struggle with:
• Manual tenant communication and lease tracking
• Disconnected systems for maintenance requests
• Time-consuming financial reporting
• Inefficient booking and availability management

We've helped companies like GuestReady and ANRG implement 
automation that:
✓ Reduced admin time by 40%
✓ Improved tenant satisfaction by 35%
✓ Cut operational costs by 30%

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to explore if 
this could benefit [Company Name]?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
ScholarixGlobal.com
[Your Phone]
